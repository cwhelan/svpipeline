Only one genomic location is diagrammed here for simplicity. Reducers then compute features for each location on the genome by fitting a GMM to the distribution of spanning insert sizes.

\section{Runtime Analysis}

We implemented and executed Cloudbreak on a 56-node Hadoop cluster, with 636 map slots and 477 reduce slots. Not including alignment time, we were able to process the Chromosome 2 simulated data in under five minutes, and the the NA18507 data set in under 15 minutes. For the simulated data set we used 100 reducers for the compute SV features job; for the real data set we used 300. The bulk of Cloudbreak's execution is spent in the feature generation step. Extracting deletion and insertion calls take under two minutes each for both the real and simulated data sets; the times are equal because each reducer is responsible for processing a single chromosome, and so the runtime is bounded by the length of time it takes to process the largest chromosome. 

In Table \ref{runtimes} we display a comparison of runtimes on the real and simulated data sets for all of the tools evaluated in this work. Each tool varies in the amount of parallelization supported. We report runtimes for tools run in their default single-threaded mode, as well as for levels of parallelization achievable with basic scripting, noting that one of the key advantages of Hadoop/MapReduce is the ability to scale parallel execution to the size of the available compute cluster without any custom programming. Pindel allows multi-threaded operation on multicore servers. Pindel and Breakdancer allow processing of a single chromosome in one process, so it is possible to execute all chromosomes in parallel on a cluster that has a job scheduler and shared filesystem. Breakdancer has an additional preprocessing step (\texttt{bam2cfg.pl}) which runs in a single thread. DELLY suggests splitting the input BAM file by chromosome, after which a separate DELLY process can be executed on the data for each chromosome; splitting a large BAM file is a time consuming process and consumes most of the time in this parallel workflow, in fact making it faster to run in single-threaded mode. GASVPro allows parallelization of the MCMC component for resolving ambiguously mapped read pairs; however, this requires a significant amount of custom scripting, and we did not find that the MCMC module consumed most of the runtime in our experiments, so we do not attempt to parallelize this component. The MoDIL distribution contains a set of scripts that can be used to submit parallel jobs to the SGE scheduling engine or modified for other schedulers; we adapted these for use in our cluster.

In parallel execution, the total time to execute is bounded by the runtime of the longest-running process. In the case of chromosome-parallelizable tools including Breakdancer, Pindel, and DELLY, this is typically the process working on the largest chromosome.\footnote{We note that one Breakdancer process, handling an unplaced contig in the hg19 reference genome, never completed in our runs and had to be killed manually; we exclude that process from our results.} In the case of MoDIL's run on the simulated data, we found that the different processes varied widely in their execution times, likely caused by regions of high coverage or with many ambiguously mapped reads. Cloudbreak mitigates this problem during the time-consuming feature generation process by using Hadoop partitioners to randomly assign each genomic location to one of the set of reducers, ensuring that the work is evenly distributed across all processes. This distribution of processing across the entire cluster also serves to protect against server slowdowns and hardware failures - for example, we were still able to complete processing of the NA18507 data set during a run where one of the compute nodes was rebooted midway through the feature generation job.

\section{Cloudbreak User Manual}
\label{cloudbreak}

Cloudbreak is a Hadoop-based structural variation (SV) caller for Illumina
paired-end DNA sequencing data. Currently Cloudbreak calls genomic insertions
and deletions; we are working on adding support for other types of SVs.

Cloudbreak contains a full pipeline for aligning your data in the form of FASTQ
files using alignment pipelines that generate many possible mappings for every
read, in the Hadoop framework. It then contains Hadoop jobs for computing
genomic features from the alignments, and for calling insertion and deletion
variants from those features.

You can get Cloudbreak by downloading a pre-packaged release from the ``releases''
tab in the GitHub repository, or by building from source as described below.

\subsection{Building From Source}
\label{buildingfromsource}

To build the latest version of Cloudbreak, clone the GitHub repository. You'll
need to install Maven to build the executables. (http:/\slash maven.apache.org\slash )
Enter the top level directory of the Cloudbreak repository and type the command:

\texttt{mvn package}

This should compile the code, execute tests, and create a distribution file, \linebreak
 \texttt{cloudbreak-\$VERSION-dist.tar.gz}, in the \texttt{target\slash } directory. You can then copy
 that distribution file to somewhere else on your system, unpack it with:

 \texttt{tar -xzvf cloudbreak-\$VERSION-dist.tar.gz} 

and access the Cloudbreak jar file and related scripts and properties files.

\subsection{Dependencies}
\label{dependencies}

Cloudbreak requires a cluster Hadoop 0.20.2 or Cloudera CDH3 to run (the older
mapreduce API). If you don't have a Hadoop cluster, Cloudbreak can also use the
Apache Whirr API to automatically provision a cluster on the Amazon Elastic
Compute Cloud (EC2). See the section on using WHIRR below.

If you wish to run alignments using Cloudbreak, you will need one of the following
supported aligners:

\begin{itemize}
\item BWA (Recommended): http:/\slash bio-bwa.sourceforge.net\slash 

\item GEM: http:/\slash algorithms.cnag.cat\slash wiki\slash The\_GEM\_library

\item RazerS 3: http:/\slash www.seqan.de\slash projects\slash razers\slash 

\item Bowtie2: http:/\slash bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net\slash bowtie2\slash index.shtml

\item Novoalign: http:/\slash www.novocraft.com

\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Guide}
\label{userguide}

You can use Cloudbreak in several different ways, depending on whether you want
to start with FASTQ files and use Hadoop to help parallelize your alignments, or if you already
have an aligned BAM file and just want to use Cloudbreak to call variants. In addition,
the workflow is slightly different depending on whether you want to run on a local
hadoop cluster or want to run using a cloud provider like Amazon EC2. Later in this
file, we've listed a set of scenarios to describe options for running the Cloudbreak
pipeline. Find the scenario that best fits your use case for more details on how to
run that workflow. For each scenario, we have created a template script that contains
all of the steps and parameters you need, which you can modify for your particular data set.

\subsection{Running on a cloud provider like Amazon EC2 with Whirr}
\label{runningonacloudproviderlikeamazonec2withwhirr}

Cloudbreak has support for automatically deploying a Hadoop cluster on
cloud providers such as Amazon EC2, transferring your data there, running the Cloudbreak algorithm, and
downloading the results.

Of course, renting compute time on EC2 or other clouds costs money, so please be
familiar with the appropriate usage and billing policies of your cloud provider
before attempting this.

WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR UNEXPECTED CHARGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR ON EC2 OR
OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS.

Many properties that affect the cluster created can be set in the file
\texttt{cloudbreak-whirr.properties} in this distribution. You will need to edit this file
to set your AWS access key and secret access key (or your credentials for other
cloud provider services), and to tell it the location of the public and
private SSH keys to use to access the cluster. You can also control the number
and type of nodes to include in the cluster. The default settings in the file
create 15 nodes of type m1.xlarge, which is sufficient to fully process a 30X
simulation of human chromosome 2, including read alignment and data transfer time,
in under an hour. We have only tested this capability using EC2; other cloud providers
may not work as well. You can also direct Whirr to use Amazon EC2's spot instances, which are
dramatically cheaper than on-demand instances, although they carry the risk of
being terminated if your price is out-bid. Using recent spot pricing, it cost
us about \$5 to run the aforementioned chromosome 2 simulation. We recommend
setting your spot bid price to be the on demand price for the instance type you
are using to minimize the chance of having your instances terminated.

Please consult Amazon's EC2 documentation and the documentation for Whirr for
more information on how to configure and deploy clusters in the cloud.

\subsection{Running on a Small Example Data Set}
\label{runningonasmallexampledataset}

To facilitate testing of Cloudbreak, we have publicly hosted the reads from the simulated
data example described in the Cloudbreak manuscript on a bucket in Amazon's S3 storage
 service at s3:/\slash cloudbreak-example\slash . We have also provided an example script that creates
 a cluster in Amazon EC2, copies the data to the cluster, runs the full Cloudbreak
 workflow including alignments with BWA, and copies the variant calls back to the
 local machine before destroying the cluster. The script, called \texttt{Cloudbreak-EC2-whirr-example.sh}
 is in the scripts directory of the Cloudbreak distribution. Of course, you will still
 need to edit the \texttt{cloudbreak-whirr.properties} file with your EC2 credentials, and verify
 that the cluster size, instance types, and spot price are to your liking before
 executing the example.

\subsubsection{Scenario 1: Compute alignments in Hadoop, using a local Hadoop cluster}
\label{scenario1:computealignmentsinhadoopusingalocalhadoopcluster}

To install aligner dependencies for use by Cloudbreak, first generate the index
for the genome reference you would like to run against. Then, copy all of the
required index files, and the executable files for the aligner into HDFS using
the \texttt{hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal} command. For BWA you will need all of the index files
created by running \texttt{bwa index}. You will also need an `fai' file for the reference,
containing chromosome names and lengths, generated by \texttt{samtools faidx}.

If your reference file is \texttt{reference.fa}, and \texttt{bwa aln} has created the files

\begin{verbatim}
reference.fa.amb
reference.fa.ann
reference.fa.bwt
reference.fa.pac
reference.fa.sa
\end{verbatim}

and \texttt{reference.fa.fai} as described above, issue the following
commands to load the necessary files into HDFS:

\begin{verbatim}
hdfs -mkdir indices/
hdfs -mkdir executables/
hdfs -copyFromLocal reference.fa.amb indices/
hdfs -copyFromLocal reference.fa.ann indices/
hdfs -copyFromLocal reference.fa.bwt indices/
hdfs -copyFromLocal reference.fa.pac indices/
hdfs -copyFromLocal reference.fa.sa indices/
hdfs -copyFromLocal reference.fa.fai indices/
hdfs -copyFromLocal /path/to/bwa/executables/bwa executables/
hdfs -copyFromLocal /path/to/bwa/executables/xa2multi.pl executables/
\end{verbatim}

The basic workflow is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Load the FASTQ files into HDFS

\item Run one of the Cloudbreak alignment commands to align your reads

\item Create a readGroup file to describe the location and insert size characteristics of your reads, and copy it into HDFS.

\item Run the GMM fitting feature generation step of the Cloudbreak process.

\item Extract deletion calls from the features created in step 4.

\item Copy the deletion calls from HDFS to a local directory.

\item Extract insertion calls from the features created in step 4.

\item Copy the insertion calls from HDFS to a local directory.

\item Optionally, export the alignments back into a BAM file in your local filesystem.

\end{enumerate}

We have created a script to run through the full process of executing the
Cloudbreak pipeline from FASTQ files to insertion and deletion calls. The
script is named \texttt{Cloudbreak-full.sh} and can be found in the scripts directory
of the Cloudbreak distribution. To customize the script for your needs, copy
it to a new location and edit the variables in the first three sections:
``EXPERIMENT DETAILS'', ``LOCAL FILES AND DIRECTORIES'', and
``HDFS FILES AND DIRECTORIES''.

\subsubsection{Scenario 2: Call variants on existing alignments, using a local Hadoop cluster}
\label{scenario2:callvariantsonexistingalignmentsusingalocalhadoopcluster}

For this scenario you don't need to worry about having an aligner executable or
aligner-generated reference in HDFS. You will however, need a chromosome length
`fai' file, which you can generate by running \texttt{samtools faidx} on your reference
FASTA files and then copying to HDFS:

\begin{verbatim}
hdfs -copyFromLocal reference.fa.fai indices/
\end{verbatim}

After that, the workflow is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Load your BAM file into HDFS and prepare it for Cloudbreak

\item Create a readGroup file to describe the location and insert size characteristics of your reads.

\item Run the GMM fitting feature generation step of the Cloudbreak process.

\item Extract deletion calls from the features created in step 3.

\item Copy the deletion calls from HDFS to a local directory.

\item Extract insertion calls from the features created in step 3.

\item Copy the insertion calls from HDFS to a local directory.

\end{enumerate}

To prepare alignments for Cloudbreak, they must be sorted by read name. You can then use the
 \texttt{readSAMFileIntoHDFS} Cloudbreak command.

A templates for this scenario is available in the script \texttt{Cloudbreak-variants-only.sh}
located in the scripts directory of the Cloudbreak distribution.

\subsubsection{Scenario 3: Compute alignments in Hadoop, using a cloud provider like EC2}
\label{scenario3:computealignmentsinhadoopusingacloudproviderlikeec2}

First, see the section ``Running on a Cloud Provider like Amazon EC2 with Whirr'' above, and modify the file
\texttt{cloudbreak-whirr.properties} to include your access credentials and the appropriate cluster
specifications. After that, the workflow is similar to the workflow described for scenario \#1
above, with the additional first steps of copying your reads and dependency files to the cloud and
creating a cluster before processing begins, and then destroying the cluster after processing has
completed.

You can see an example workflow involving EC2 by examining the script
\texttt{Cloudbreak-EC2-whirr.sh}. This begins by transferring your reads to Amazon S3. It then
uses Apache Whirr to launch an EC2 Hadoop cluster, copies the necessary executable files
to EC2, and runs the algorithm.

\subsubsection{Scenario 4: Call variants on existing alignments, using a cloud provider like EC2}
\label{scenario4:callvariantsonexistingalignmentsusingacloudproviderlikeec2}

Again, please read the section ``Running on a Cloud Provider like Amazon EC2 with Whirr'' above to learn how to
update the \texttt{cloudbreak-whirr.properties} file with your credentials and cluster specifications. After that,
follow the template in the script \texttt{Cloudbreak-EC2-whirr-variants-only.sh} to create a workflow
involving calling variants in the cloud.

The output from running Cloudbreak using one of the scripts above will be found in the files named

\begin{verbatim}
READ_GROUP_LIBRARY_dels_genotyped.bed
READ_GROUP_LIBRARY_ins_genotyped.bed
\end{verbatim}

where READ\_GROUP and LIBRARY are the names of the reads in your experiment. The
format of the files is tab-delimited with the following columns:

\begin{itemize}
\item CHROMOSOME: The chromosome of the deletion call

\item START: The start coordinate of the deletion call

\item END: The end coordinate of the deletion call

\item NUMBER: The cloudbreak identifier of the deletion call

\item LR: The likelihood ratio of the deletion (higher indicates a call more likely to be true)

\item TYPE: Either ``INS'' or ``DEL''

\item W: The average weight of the estimated GMM mixing parameter alpha, used in genotyping

\item GENOTYPE: The predicted genotype of the call

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reference Guide}
\label{referenceguide}

All of Cloudbreak's functionality is contained in the executable jar file in the
directory where you unpacked the Cloudbreak distribution. Use the `hadoop'
command to run the jar file to ensure that the necessary Hadoop dependencies
are available to Cloudbreak.

To invoke any Cloudbreak command, use a command line in this format:

\texttt{hadoop cloudbreak-\$\{project.version\}.jar [options] [command] [command options]}

Where \texttt{command} is the name of the command, \texttt{command options} are the arguments specific
to that command, and \texttt{options} are general options, including options for how to run
Hadoop jobs. For example, if you'd like to specify 50 reduce tasks
for one of your commands, pass in \texttt{-Dmapred.reduce.tasks=50} as one of the general options. 

Each command is detailed below and its options are listed below. You can view this information by typing
\texttt{hadoop jar cloudbreak-\$\{project.version\}.jar} without any additional parameters.
